                All GraphQL API queries require a valid Embedded ID and token
                (master or user) passed as a bearer.
              </p>
              <p>
                Public and custom apps created in the Partner Dashboard generate
                tokens using OAuth, and custom apps made in the Shopify admin
                are authenticated in the Shopify admin.
              </p>
              <p>
                Include your token as a X-Shopify-Access-Token header on all API
                queries. Using Shopifyâ€™s supported client libraries can simplify
                this process. To keep the platform secure, apps need to request
                specific access scopes during the install process. Only request
                as much data access as your app needs to work. Learn more about
                getting started with authentication and building apps.
